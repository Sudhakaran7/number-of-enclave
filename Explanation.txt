Given a 2D array A, each cell is 0 (representing sea) or 1 (representing land)
A move consists of walking from one land square 4-directionally to another land square, or off the boundary of the grid.
Return the number of land squares in the grid for which we cannot walk off the boundary of the grid in any number of moves.

 Input Description:
 First line contains n the size of 2D array, (2<n<1000)
 Rest line contains, nxn 2D array.
 
 Output Description:
 Print the number of land squares in the grid for which we cannot walk off the boundary of the grid in any number of moves.
